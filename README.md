# Monocle 1.0.2
### Build Awesome CoffeeScript MVC Applications

## Friend of my friends
I'm built to work with the most famous libraries of the web development. If your project is desktop you can use me with jQuery and if on the contrary it is a mobile project I will perfectly mixed with QuoJS or Zepto.

[Source code](https://github.com/soyjavi/monocle) and [issue tracking](https://github.com/soyjavi/monocle/issues) are available on Github.

## I like writing with class
I'm made to work seamlessly with CoffeeScript, a simple and elegant language. With me all your applications will be pure verbosity and poetry. If you also want to use me in old-school mode with the all powerful of JavaScript.

## I use a grateful pattern
I use the MVC pattern therefore I am a fashion victim. All this would not have been possible if my creator @soyjavi had not met the inspiring work of @maccman. You can contribute and help me to be better everyday.
